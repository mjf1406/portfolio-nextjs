            "Last year, whenever I needed to give a lesson using the whiteboard, I had to pick up my markers one at a time along with the eraser and carry it over to the whiteboard. Now, I could have put them all into a basket or something, which I did, but I still had to keep the markers on top of a bookcase next to the whiteboard, which was in an awkward spot. The walls are magnetic, though! Gosh, how convenient would it be for it to be magnetic so I could store it behind my desk when not needed, then quickly grab it to move to the whiteboard and stick it right next to the board in the perfect place? \n\nSo, I looked for a product to buy that was magnetic, but there were none that met my requirements. If only I had a 3D printer! Then, I could design it to my exact requirements! And this is the story of how I got into 3D printing. Now, I store my markers on the wall behind my desk, and when I need them, grab 'em and stick 'em next to the whiteboard in the exact right place.",

There was no convenient way to organize the cables and the Chromebooks together, nor to label each Chromebook clearly. So, I designed this. \n\nIt holds a cable for each Chromebook, has an integrated label that can be seen when there is no Chromebook inside, and organizes them into two different colors so each of my two Chromebook Captains know which ones they're responsible for. The label only being visible when there is no Chromebook stowed is not a problem because the Chromebooks themselves have labels on them that are visible when they are stowed.",

One of my D&D players correctly predicted that they would fall at some point ðŸ˜‚ I then had to accept defeat and install them back onto the speaker stands and place them on the floor behind my couch -- until I got a 3D printer! \n\nI designed these to use four N52 32 x 3 mm neodymium magnets to hold up the speakers and they work splendidly! That is, until I made some level adjustments to the speakers as they were farther away now.",

            "In 2020, I moved back to my hometown and started playing D&D with my friends there and we needed a way to identify different tokens. Oh, Tymora! Blessed as I was by Tymora's luck-filled touch, I found 1 cm circular tokens in 6 colors in my childhood bedroom from my time in China when I wanted to create my own TTRPG system with a friend there. So, I wrote numbers on all of the tokens and that was pretty good, but I'm color deficient, so I had a really hard time distinguishing those tokens -- until I got a 3D printer! \n\nWhen designing these, I struggled with how to mesh colors and shapes until I settled on using one color per creature size and different shapes to distinguish enemy types within those sizes, but also ensure that no shape was repeated across colors (creature size). This means that, if anyone needed, they could identify each type by shape alone, the color would merely provide extra, although unnecessary, information about them because the tokens physical size is representative of its size in the game world.",
